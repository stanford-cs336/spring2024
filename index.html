    <h3>What is this course about?</h3>
    <p> Language models serve as the cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP) applications and open up a new paradigm of having a single general purpose system address a range of downstream tasks. As the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and NLP continues to grow, possessing a deep understanding of language models becomes essential for scientists and engineers alike. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of language models by walking them through the entire process of developing their own. Drawing inspiration from operating systems courses that create an entire operating system from scratch, we will lead students through every aspect of language model creation, including data collection and cleansing for pre-training, transformer model construction, model training, and evaluation before deployment. </p>
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Proficiency in Python</b>
        <p> We expect the majority of class assignments to be in Python, and students will be given minimal scaffolding. The assignment complexity and size will assume that students are capable Python programmers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Experience with deep learning and systems optimization</b>
        <p> A significant part of the course will involve making neural language models run quickly and efficiently on GPUs across multiple machines. We expect students to be able to have a strong familiarity with PyTorch and know basic systems concepts like the memory hierarchy.
      <li>
        <b>College Calculus, Linear Algebra</b> (e.g. MATH 51, CME 100) <p>You should be comfortable taking (multivariable) derivatives and understanding matrix/vector notation and operations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Basic Probability and Statistics</b> (e.g. CS 109 or equivalent) <p>You should know the basics of probabilities, Gaussian distributions, mean, standard deviation, etc.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Coursework</h2>
      <h3>Assignments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>There are four assignments in this course</b>: <ul>
            <li>Assignment 1: Basics</li>
            <ul> <li> Implement all of the components (tokenizer, optimizer, architecture) necessary to train a standard, high-performance Transformer language model. </li>
                 <li> Train a minimal language model </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Assignment 2: Systems and scaling</li>
            <ul> <li> Build the framework necessary to perform memory-efficient, distributed optimization of a large scale version of the Assignment 1 model. </li>
                 <li> Fit and use scaling laws to determine how to scale up the model. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Assignment 3: Data</li>
            <ul> <li> Filter and convert raw common crawl outputs into usable pretraining data </li>
              <li> Select and weight data to optimize LM performance </li>
              </ul>
            <li>Assignment 4: Alignment</li>
            <ul> <li> Build and curate instruction-tuning data for the model </li>
              <li> Implement and apply RLHF to further optimize the model </li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>
          <b>Deadlines</b>: All assignments are due on either a Monday or a Wednesday <i>before class</i> (i.e. before 1:30pm). All deadlines are listed in the <a href="#schedule">schedule</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Collaboration</b>: Study groups are allowed, but students must understand and complete their own assignments, and hand in one assignment per student. If you worked in a group, please put the names of the members of your study group at the top of your assignment. Please ask if you have any questions about the collaboration policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Honor Code</b>: We expect students to not look at solutions or implementations online. Like all other classes at Stanford, we take the student <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/academics/masters-handbook/honor-code">Honor Code</a> seriously. We sometimes use automated methods to detect overly similar assignment solutions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Submitting coursework</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All coursework are submitted via Gradescope by the deadline. Do not submit your coursework via email.</li>
        <li>If anything goes wrong, please ask a question on Ed or contact a course assistant.</li>
        <li>You can submit as many times as you’d like until the deadline: we will only grade the last submission.</li>
        <li>Partial work is better than not submitting any work.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Late Days</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A homework is ⌈d⌉ days late if it is turned in d days past the due date (note that this means if you are 1 second late, ⌈d⌉=1 and it is 1 day late).</li>
        <li>Each student has <b>6 late days to use</b>. A late day extends the deadline by 24 hours. </li>
        <li> Once a student is out a late days, the maximum possible grade for an assigment is decreased by 25% for each day past the deadline. For example, if a student is out of late days and submits one day late, an original grade of 90% on the assignment will be reduced to 75%, but an original grade of 72% will be unchanged. </li>
        <li>You can use up to 3 late days per assignment. <b>Submissions will not be accepted 3 days past the original deadline.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Regrade Requests</h3>
      <p> If you believe that the course staff made an objective error in grading, you may submit a regrade request on Gradescope within 3 days after the grades are released. Note that we may regrade your entire submission, so that depending on your submission you may actually lose more points than you gain.
